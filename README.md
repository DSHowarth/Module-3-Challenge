# Random Password Generator

## Description
This is a simple website that will generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters, that is easily copy/pastable into any password field.
You can even select whether you want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

## Usage
Simply go to https://dshowarth.github.io/Module-3-Challenge/, click the 'Generate Password' button, and follow the prompts on the screen.

## Lessons Learned
- Objects are not ordered, so you can't iterate over them with a for loop
- Handling various edge cases/errors took more time than coding the generator.
- Using i-- to 'roll back' a for loop is less messy than using recursive functions (when possible).
- Debugging an issue is much more annoying when the bug is an infinite loop that crashes your browser tab
every time you try to test something.
